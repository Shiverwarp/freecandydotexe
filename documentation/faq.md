### Migrating from SVN to Git

If you are having issues running the script, we would highly recommend converting from previous SVN installs to Git; having two versions of the same script is unsupported behavior that often leads to scope issues and areas where Mafia runs the older version of the script. Mafia support has been implemented for git in recent revisions, so freecandy users should update their mafia, remove the old SVN repo and convert to git.

```
svn delete Loathing-Associates-Scripting-Society-freecandydotexe-branches-release
```

Then install freecandy.exe as normal, in the core readme.
